## Key Features

1. **Collaborative Filtering:** The system employs collaborative filtering techniques to generate recommendations based on user similarity.

2. **Data Processing:** Scripts for loading and preprocessing data are included. Input data must follow a specific format to ensure proper functioning of the system.

3. **Model Training:** The recommendation model is trained using the collaborative filtering algorithm. Examples are provided on how to adjust parameters and enhance the model's performance.

4. **Recommendation Generation:** Once the model is trained, it can be used to generate personalized recommendations for specific users.

## System Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, among others. You can install them using the following command:
